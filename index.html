          Hi, my name is Alex, I'm a Software Developer. I mainly work with
          C#/.NET, C++, sometimes JavaScript/TypeScript with AngularJS, and
          occasionaly VB6 as part of my day job.
          I also do some minor work with Azure DevOps build pipelines.
        </p>
        <p>
          I like to explore languages and technologies that I'm unfamiliar with outside of work
          while working on hobby projects. I've recently read through the Haskell 
          <a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/">Learn You a Haskell for Great Good Book</a>,
          which I highly recommend if you're wanting to get your feet wet with Haskell; Haskell,
          also happens to be a really good way to learn more about functional programming,
          and it will likely change the way you approach problems even within other languages.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've also recently been interested in emulation and have created a 
          <a href="https://gitlab.com/riveron91/CHIP-8-C">CHIP-8 emulator written in C</a>,
          as well as some 
          <a href="https://gitlab.com/riveron91/CHIP-8-TOOLS-GO">CHIP-8 tooling written in Go</a>
          for assembling and disassembling CHIP-8 programs.
          Go also happens to be a language that I have very recently started to pick up and enjoy learning.
          The <a href="https://golang.org/doc/">Go docs</a> are a really good resource and the
          <a href="https://golang.org/ref/spec">language spec</a> seems very accesible.
        </p>
        <p>
          This website is in need of some TLC. I've been meaning to update it for a while now,
          but keep getting distracted with other things. I will be starting a Master's
          in CS (at Georgia Tech!) soon, but I'm hoping to carve out some time to update it
          in the near future. The idea is to have a page to showcase my hobby projects,
          and another landing page for a tech related blog; currently, it's just the projects section that's
          live, with most of the projects on it not updated since 2018 or 2019. The idea of having a blog
          sounds like fun to me.
        </p>

          in the future.
